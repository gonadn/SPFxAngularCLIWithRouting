// This file recreates the command-line options that were built into Rush prior to version 4.
// Note that earlier versions of Rush also performed the following transformations to
// produce the command-line that was passed to the NPM scripts in the project's
// package.json file:
//
// - If "--vso" was passed to Rush, then "--color" was passed to the script instead
// - Before running a "build" script, the "clean" script was automatically executed first
//
// Rush 4 no longer performs these sorts of transformations.  Instead, it aims for
// the Rush options and script options to be as similar as possible.
//
// To use this example file, rename it to "command-line.json" and copy it into your
// "common/config/rush" folder.  For more information about custom commands,
// see the documentation at https://aka.ms/rush
